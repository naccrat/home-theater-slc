        <h2 class="py-3">Projector Screen Aspect Ratio</h2>
        <p>One important factor for selecting a projector screen is the aspect ratio. Different movies and TV shows have different aspect ratios. You want to choose a screen that matches the aspect ratio of the content you'll be watching. You can also select a projector screen that will work for many aspect ratios. Some of the most common aspect ratios are 16:9, 2.35:1, and 4:3, among others.</p>
        <h2 class="py-3">Projector Screen Gain</h2>
        <p>Another crucial factor to consider when selecting a projector screen is the gain. Gain is a measure of the screen's reflective ability. Higher-gain screens reflect more light and can deliver brighter images. The down side is they can also produce hotspots or uneven lighting. Lower gain screens reflect less light but can deliver a more uniform image. Our team can help you determine the optimal gain for your specific setup.</p>

        <h2 class="py-3">Projector Screen Material</h2>
        <p>We also offer a range of screen materials, including matte white, high-contrast gray, and ambient light-rejecting (ALR) screens. Matte white screens are the most common and are ideal for dedicated home theater setups. High-contrast gray screens can deliver deeper blacks and richer colors. ALR screens are designed to reject ambient light and are perfect for spaces with a lot of natural light.</p>
