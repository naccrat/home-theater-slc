        <h2 class="py-3">Smart lighting energy efficiency</h2>
        <p>One of the primary benefits of smart lighting energy efficiency. By using LED bulbs and optimizing the brightness and timing of your lights, you can reduce your energy usage. Smart lighting allows you to create different lighting scenes. This can be used for different activities and moods. This works great for reading, cooking, or relaxing so that you can set the perfect mood for any occasion.</p>

        <p>Another major advantage of smart lighting is increased convenience. You have the ability to control your lights using an app or voice command. No longer do you have to get up from your seat to turn off the lights or adjust the brightness. This can be useful in situations where you have your hands full, such as when carrying groceries or a baby.</p>

        <p>Smart lighting can also enhance the safety and security of your home. By setting up a schedule for your lights to turn on and off, you can create the illusion that someone is home. This can deter burglars and intruders. Some smart lighting systems come with motion sensors. They can detect and alert you to any unusual activity in or around your home.</p>
